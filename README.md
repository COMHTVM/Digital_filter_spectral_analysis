# Digital_filter_and_spectral_analysis
Interpretation, design and application of DSP techniques. Digital filters and Fourier transform based spectrum analysis. Spectral descriptions of continuous-time and discrete-time waveforms related, and the FFT algorithm is used as a spectral analysis tool. The behaviour of digital filters is analysed through the use of difference equations and transfer functions via the z-transform. Methods for designing IIR and FIR filters, and various issues associated with their practical implementation.
